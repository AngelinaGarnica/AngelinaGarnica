# 👋 Hi there, I'm Angelina

Economist turned Data Scientist with a strong background in statistics, machine learning, and many years of experience working with data. I’ve built everything from KPIs and impact reports to machine learning models that power product recommendations and improve user retention. These days, I’m focused on machine learning consulting—helping businesses turn raw data into real-world decisions. Always learning, always building.
